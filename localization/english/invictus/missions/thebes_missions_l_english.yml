me_thebes_9_desc:0 "In Delphi, the navel of the world, where the sacred Omphalos stone marks its center, there is an Oracle known as the Pythia. It is known that those who venture to Delphi to see her, entering her cave of prophecy as the sacred vapors envelop her, can learn that which the gods have hidden from the eyes of men. But be advised that the gods are not to be toyed with, and the future sometimes holds secrets that are best left unknown. Shall we make preparations to visit the Oracle?"

me_thebes_10_title:0 "The Oracle of Delphi"
me_thebes_10_desc_1:0 "All is quiet and calm in the sanctuary of Apollo, where you have arrived for your consultation with the Pythia, the Oracle of Delphi. Just a few moments earlier, you completed the requisite steps for a visiting pilgrim that seeks to gain knowledge; a choice black ram, the finest that you could find, was sacrificed, and you left a generous donation with the caretakers of the temple. After a brief wait, you are led down into the chamber where the Pythia utters her prophesies. As vapors flow from the cracks underneath of her tripod, the Pythia rolls her head back and convulses, the words gasping forth from her mouth in jagged spurts that sends a chill up your back -[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] will lead Thebes to greatness!"
me_thebes_10_desc_2:0 "You have entered the chamber of the Pythia, a dark cavern underneath a shrine to Apollo. The air is thick with the cloying stench of burning laurel leaves and blackened barley, an unpleasant smell that reminds you of battlefields you have seen. There is a tense feeling in the chamber, something that you were not expecting. A bead of sweat runs down your forehead as you peer through the haze, your eyes trying to adjust to the gloom. When you hear the Pythia speak, a solemn intonation that sets your hair on edge, your heart falls into your stomach at her words - [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] will lead Thebes to destruction..."
me_thebes_10_desc_3:0 "As you turn to leave the chamber of the Pythia, your legs trembling as you step back into the fading sunlight, you can see the expectant faces of your entourage waiting outside. When their eyes meet yours, at once all of their faces darken, and some step backwards, obviously shocked at how pale you are. You try to laugh, but only a manage to cough a little bit. Shaking your head, you clear your throat and give the order to leave. As you walk towards town through the gathering gloom, the words of the prophecy stumble through your head. Although accused of speaking in riddles, the Pythia was blunt in her offering tonight, repeating the same phrase again and again; [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] will die soon..."
me_thebes_10_desc_4:0 "Although you have been introduced as [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] from Thebes, the Pythia speaks in riddles about the glory of the Argead line. She offers strange and confusing metaphors of branches blooming out of branches, of snakes devouring themselves and becoming one. Ancient blood destroying, ancient blood rebuilding. The Pythia is staring at you now, calling you the child of Caranus...what is she saying? Could she really mean..."

Many times our arguments have been solely diplomatic, whereas other times we have had to chastise their soldiers on the battlefield for their hubris. But the potential threat they represent is too great, and it has been decided that they shall be destroyed once and for all."

me_thebes_14_title:0 "Achaea is ours!"
me_thebes_14_desc:0 "Since we have consolidated the territories directly surrounding the hinterlands of Thebes, it should come as no surprise that we have continued our expansion by securing our dominion over the province of Achaea.

They have chosen wisely in supporting us!"
me_thebes_16.a:0 "[target.GetName] will send troops when war erupts!"

me_thebes_17_title:0 "Troops Arrive from [target.GetName]"
me_thebes_17_desc:0 "When the appointed day arrived, you did not have to wait long for the troops from [target.GetName] to reach Thebes. And what a group of warriors that was sent to you!
