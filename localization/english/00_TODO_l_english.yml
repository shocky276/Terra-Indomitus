yue_bloodline:0 Blood of Yue"
yue_bloodline_desc:0 "King Yue, originator of the bloodline, was the descendant of his ancestor Yu and the bastard son of Emperor Xia Shaokang.

yan_bloodline:0 "Blood of Yan"
yan_bloodline_desc:0 "The Yan are known to focus on settling unfinished business, emulating their ancestors that put an end to the Shang Dynasty.

han_bloodline_desc:0 "When the Records and Annals are compiled and the deeds of the people are measured, are there any that can compare to the Han?

zhao_bloodline:0 "Blood of Zhao"
zhao_bloodline_desc:0 "The ancestors of the Zhao clan shared ancestors with Qin, a fact that they are proud of. Yet the Zhao are not the type to claim the glories of others as there own, and why would they? The Zhao are determined fighters, more than capable of securing their own victories."

teng_bloodline:0 "Blood of Teng"
teng_bloodline_desc:0 "The blood that is found amongst the royalty of Teng descends from the Zhou family, making it an auspicious addition to any royal household. While the territory ruled by the Teng is small, their hearts are large, more than making up for any imagined deficits."
zhaoxian_bloodline:0 "Blood of Zhaoxian"
zhaoxian_bloodline_desc:0 "The Zhaoxian bloodlines can be traced back far, to an ancestor of the Korean monarch named Keizi; what is known is that his surname was Xu Yu, and he was from Yin.
